## Examples

**Calling tabled from a Drupal JS file**

This will render every table using Tabled, exept by those specifically defined as "stacked" and also excluding layout builder tables.

```
((Drupal, once) => {
  /**
   * Initialize the behavior.
   *
   * @type {Drupal~behavior}
   *
   * @prop {Drupal~behaviorAttach} attach
   *   Attach context and settings for the plugin.
   */
  Drupal.behaviors.tabled = {
    tableCount: 0,
    attach: function (context) {
      let index = Drupal.behaviors.tabled.tableCount;
      const tables = once('tabled',
      'table:not(.tabled--stacked):not([data-drupal-selector="edit-settings-selection-table"])'
      , context);
      const options = { failClass: 'table--stacked' };
      tables.forEach((table) => {
      	new Tabled(table, index++, options);
      });
      Drupal.behaviors.tabled.tableCount = index;
    },
  };
})(Drupal, once);
```
